# Example of Chatbot with temperature sensor

This project structure was initialized with `lifoid init` command.

You can personalize the environment file `.env` according to the
`.env.example` file and specification provided in Lifoid project root.

Make sure there is a MQTT Broker available, e.g. Mosquitto.

Here is an example to launch the bot with a local MQTT broker:

```
lifoid mqtt_bot --host localhost --port 1883 --lifoid_id simple-bot
```

In a separate terminal use `mosquitto_pub` tool to simulate information sent
by a temperature sensor:

```
mosquitto_pub -t temperature -m 27.3
```

Then let's chat with this bot:

```
lifoid mqtt_client --host localhost --port 1883 --lifoid_id simple-bot
